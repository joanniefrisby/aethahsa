So I am not going to commit suicide or anything, I just wanted to prove to myself I could write a poem in Sedsu and I appearently listened to a lot of songs about death (Thoughts of a Dying Atheist, anyone?) so that's what came to my mind. In my con-world, the poem is written by a poet named "August" who lives in the post-triumvirate period in Rome as colonisator from Regies Raanomi (Divine Kingdom), from the planet "Uiqaar"(the home planet Watch the full video of Muse in Live at Rome Olympic Stadium, or preview 20 million years ago, an ape-like creature inhabited the Earth. And the ape stood, and became man. The greatest calamity that could befall early man was the loss of fire. Fire, the mysterious phenomenon that cooked his food, heated his cave, and kept him alive. If he could not start a fire, he and his would surely die. Even in most primitive man, the need to create was part of his nature. This need, this talent, clearly separated early man from animals who would never know this gift. 
The official Muse website. Home of news, tour dates, videos, music, discography, official store and message board. I was lucky enough to go to the first stop in the tour in Houston with my sisters and nephew and it was an amazing experience. I've been a huge Muse fan for a long time, and I currently live in Berlin (family lives in Texas), and would love to go see them again but they aren't coming to Berlin. Cologne is a bit far and the date isn't the best for me but I could make it work. amp#x200B; On the other hand I would love to see them in the UK, or drag my friend from Spain with me to the Madrid. –§–∏–ª—å–º "Muse - Live in Rome" –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–µ–Ω –≤ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ç–µ –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–∏–π –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–∏–¥, –ê–π—Ñ–æ–Ω We've bought tickets for Goffertpark in the Netherlands because we assumed the dates suited us more (in the end they don't.

Muse live at Rome Olympic Stadium in 2013. Awesome on TV a really incredible stage/effects. Crowd were really into it. Is it a myth or are fans abroad so much more into it than fans in the UK. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è T2L was my first time seeing Muse at the 02.

Hello r/Muse, I made a poll that you can vote in to accordingly rank your favorite albums and songs by Muse on a total ranking coming soon. I know someone is already doing something similar with a "survivor" system, but I wanted to see if this could get different results at all or if we could see anything surprising.

The 2nd Law was Muse's best era. Peak performance during live shows. Matt's voice in it's prime. Rome Olympic Stadium Movie (Their best movie, especially after watching Drones tonight). Performing the theme song of the Olympics (Survival) at the closing ceremonies. Cracking the U.S for good wth "Madness." Best performance of Dead Star ever at War Child. Runner-up James bond theme with "Supremacy" (not really, but could've). You can argue the stage setup for the live show itself, but I personally.

Muse - Live At Rome Olympic Stadium is the first concert film ever to be filmed in 4K, a format soon to be adopted by Hollywood as standard for all blockbuster films. I doubt Warner Brothers would even listen, but the band really need the message driven home that the editing, video fx (posterising wtf?) and audio mix on the cinema version of the Drones concert film was an utter disaster. When\if this thing is released on Bluray I won't be buying it. I friggin loved Live in Rome, it's easily one of THE best concert films of all time up there with the recent David Gilmour Pompeii and Rolling Stones Shine a Light. But sorry MUSE members and any fans offended. 
Muse - Live at Rome Olympic Stadium review: A concert that is not worth the price of admission. I always avoided it ever since The 2nd Law came out because impatient me listened to the first minute and gave up on it. But surfing Youtube and seeing them play it live in Rome back in 2013 made me fall in love with it. I understand why it would be stigmatized by Muse fans since its pretty poppy, but the last 2 minutes especially just melt my heart away.

General info: Hysteria, a song renowned for having one of the, if not the most iconic bass line in Muse's catalog, is a song from Muse's third LP, Absolution , released in 2003. It's a pretty straight-forward alt-rock track, with heavy guitars, roomy drums and heavily-fuzzed bass (Wolstenholme presumably used two Big Muffs) with layers of synth, playing the bass line, doubled over. The song was produced by Rich Costey and recorded in 2002/2003 at Grouse Lodge studios in Ireland. Hysteria.
